# IBM-Cloud-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-ML
Machine learning–based NIDS to detect malicious network activity and secure communications.

# Overview
*A Machine Learning–powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to identify malicious traffic patterns and secure communication networks in real time.*

*Built in IBM Cloud and developed during a 4-week internship.*

# Features
*Intelligent Threat Detection – Uses ML models to distinguish malicious traffic from normal activity.*

*Free to Deploy – Runs on IBM Cloud’s Lite plan with no cost.*

*Clear Alerts – Designed to notice abnormal network activity(Cyber attacks).*

*Flexible Integration – Can be embedded in web dashboards, accessed via API, or tested in IBM’s AI studio.*

# Usage
*You can interact with the NIDS via the scripts mentioned in this repo (Languages being Java, JavaScript and Python)*
